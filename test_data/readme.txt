This folder contains a LAS file snippet (las_snippet_fl.las) and corresponding trajectory snippet (20160517_880_p_sbet_lidar_tpu.txt) for testing purposes. These files should process in < 1 sec in cBLUE on most computers. They should be copied to seaprate folders on your computer, since you will need to specify a LAS file folder and trajectory forlder in the cBLUE GUI.
