TPU Calculations Overview
=========================

The general workflow is listed below:

    1. Form observation equation (SensorModel class)
    2. Generate Jacobian (Jacobian class)
    3. for each flight line within each Las tile:

        * Merge the Las data and trajectory data (Merge class)
        * Calculate subaerial THU and TVU (Subaerial class)
        * Calculate subaqueous THU and TVU (Subaqueous class)
        * Combine subaerial and subaqueous TPU
        * Export TPU (either as Python "pickle' or as Las extra bytes)
