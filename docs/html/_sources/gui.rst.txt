GUI Components
=================

The cBLUE GUI consists of a single window with a menu bar.

.. image:: ../images/GUI.png

Menu bar
********

The menu bar has the following categories.

.. csv-table:: cBLUE File Menu Options
	:header: Category, Options, Description
	:widths: 5, 6, 20
	
	File, Save Settings, Saves specified directories to a Json file
	.., Exit, Closes cBLUE		
	Sensor Model, Riegl VQ-880-G, "Currently, this is only a dummy menu option.  The senor model configuration for the Reigl VQ-880-G is hard-coded into cBLUE.  Development plans include refactoring the code to read sensor model information from a separate file and extending support to other lidar systems, including Leica Chiroptera 4X."
	Help, About, Displays the cBLUE splash screen (need to add versioning and copyright info)
	.., Documentation, Opens the cBLUE documentation in a web browser

Data Directories
****************

cBLUE requires three directories to be set:

.. csv-table:: cBLUE File Menu Options
	:header: Directory, Description
	:widths: 6, 20
	
	Trajectory, contains the ASCII trajectory 
	LAS, contains the LAS files
	Output, where the output files will be created

Environmental Parameters
************************

The subaqueous TPU calculations rely on characterizing two general environmental conditions:  water-surface wave conditions and turbidity.

Water Surface
-------------

The user has two options to characterize the water-surface. Both options use pre-computed coefficient lookup tables generated using Monte Carlo simulations.

* *Riegl VQ-880-G*
	This proof-of-concept option is currently limited in applicability. The lookup table used in this approach is generated from a water surface defined by a sampling of the first returns in a small area of the NOAA RSD Marcos Island project. Future development plans include deriving representative surface models for each flight line within each input tile.

* *Model (ECKV spectrum)*
	The lookup table used in this option is generated using a version of the Elfouhaily et al. (ECKV) directional gravity-capillary wave spectrum model that characterizes the distribution of wave frequencies using estimates of wind speed.
	
	.. csv-table:: ECKV Spectrum Options
		:header: options, wind speed range (kts)
		:widths: 10, 10
		
		Calm-light air, 0-2
		Light Breeze, 3-6
		Gentle Breeze, 7-10
		Moderate Breeze, 11-15
		Fresh Breeze, 16-20

Turbidity
---------

The user can chose among 5 turbidity classes.

.. csv-table:: Turbidity (Kd_490) Classes
	:header: class, value range (:math:`m^{-1}`)
	:widths: 10, 10
	
	Clear, 0.06-0.10
	Clear-Moderate, 0.11-0.17
	Moderate, 0.18-0.25
	Moderate-High, 0.26-0.32
	High, 0.33-0.36

VDatum Region
*************

The user has the option to select a VDatum region, to include the corresponding maximum cumulative uncertainty (MCU_) in the final TPU calculations.

Process Buttons
***************

	.. csv-table:: Process Buttons
		:header: Button, Function
		:widths: 20, 50
		
		Load Trajectory File(s), Loads the trajectory data from the ASCII sbet files located in the user-specified Trajectory directory into a single Pandas dataframe
		Process TPU, Initiates the TPU calculations and creates Las files with calculated TPU as variable length record (VLR) extra bytes
