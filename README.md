### Note for Contributors:

cBLUE uses pre-commit hooks for code standardization. To keep commits standard, please run the following commands before issuing a new PR:

 1. `pip install pre-commit`
 2. `cd cBLUE.github.io`
 3. `pre-commit install`

*Note: the hook `black` will cause commits to fail on first attempt and automatically reformat non-compliant code. Simply re-stage and commit the reformatted files.*
