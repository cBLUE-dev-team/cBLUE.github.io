comprehensive Bathymetric Lidar Uncertainty Estimator (cBLUE)
=============================================================

cBLUE is a tool to calculate the total propagated uncertainty of bathymetric lidar data.  Currently, the tool only supports the Riegl VQ-880-G system, but development plans include adding support for the Chiroptera II system.

cBLUE is a collaboration among the Remote Sensing Division within NOAA's National Geodetic Survey and researchers within the School of Construction and Civil Engineering at Oregon State University (`Parrish Research Group`_) and the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center (`CCOM/JHC`_) at the University of New Hampshire.
