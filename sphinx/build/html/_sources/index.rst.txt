comprehensive Bathymetric Lidar Uncertainty Estimator (cBLUE)
=============================================================

cBLUE is a tool to calculate the total propagated uncertainty of bathymetric lidar data.  Currently, the tool only supports the Riegl VQ-880-G system, but development plans include adding support for the Chiroptera II system.

cBLUE is a collaboration among the Remote Sensing Division within NOAA's National Geodetic Survey and researchers at Oregon State University and University of New Hampshire.
