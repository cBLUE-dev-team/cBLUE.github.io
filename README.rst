### Note for Contributors:
cBLUE uses pre-commit hooks for code standardization. To keep commits standard, please run the following commands issuing a PR:
 - `pip install pre-commit`
 - `cd cBLUE.github.io`
 - `pre-commit install`
*note: the hook `black` will cause commits to fail on first attempt and will automatically reformat non-compliant code. Simply re-stage and commit the reformatted files.*
